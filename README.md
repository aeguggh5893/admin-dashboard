# admin-dashboard

First attempt at the admin dashboard project. Will be learning how to utilize CSS grid for most of the assignment as well.

EDIT: 10/13
Finally finished project however it is very unpolished. Still trying to understand how to set up grid efficiently as well as
nesting the grids properly and using the justify/align properties correctly. Biggest thing is structuring but I feel like I have a
better understanding of grid now compared to before. However, still need to do some more practice and research to make the layout
look better overall. Still an unpolished project that I will come back to refactor.
